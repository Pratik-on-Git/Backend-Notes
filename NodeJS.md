# üë®‚Äçüíª Node JS
### Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser, typically on the server side.

**üìå In Simple Terms**:
Normally, JavaScript runs in browsers (like Chrome or Firefox) for things like animations, forms, and interactivity.

But Node.js lets you run JavaScript on your computer/server, so you can build backend applications like:
* Servers (e.g., APIs)
* Command-line tools
* Real-time apps (like chat apps)
* File systems or databases interaction

#### Node.js is a JavaScript Runtime Environment.
- Runs JavaScript code outside the browser.
- Built on Chrome's V8 Engine. (Made with C++)

### **Who Created Node.js and Why?**
- **Created by**: Ryan Dahl  
- **Released in**: 2009 (initial work started in 2007)
- **Reason**:
  - Traditional servers like **Apache** handled concurrent requests inefficiently.
  - Node.js was designed for **non-blocking**, event-driven, real-time applications.

### **Installing Node.js**
- Download from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- Choose:
  - **LTS (Long Term Support)**: Stable version recommended for most users.
  - **Current**: Latest features but less stable.

### **Running JavaScript Files with Node**
- Use the terminal/command prompt:
  ```bash
  node <filename> .js
  ```
- Node provides its own runtime environment with built-in **APIs** like:
  - `fs` (file system)
  - `http` (server creation)
  - `path`, etc.

### **Packages in Node.js**
- **Packages** are reusable libraries or tools.
- Installed using **npm (Node Package Manager)**.
- Example:
  ```bash
  npm install cat-me
  ```

### **Packages vs Modules**
| Feature     | Package                           | Module                        |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Definition  | Third-party tools/libraries       | Built-in features provided by Node.js |
| Source      | Installed via `npm`               | Comes with Node.js            |
| Examples    | `express`, `cat-me`               | `http`, `fs`, `path`          |

### Server Create Through HTTP Module
* Make a file named `server.js`
```
const http = require('http')
```
* While installing `cat-me` we used `npm install cat-me` but we're not using any npm packages while running `http`

**Reason**: `http` is a module, not a package.
#### Server Creation: 
```
http.createServer()
```
#### Server Start: 
```
const server = http.createServer()

server.listen(3000,()=>{
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000")
})
```
* The callback will get executed when the server is ready to take requests & handle it.
